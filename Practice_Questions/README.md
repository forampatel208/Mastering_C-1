## ðŸŒŸ **How to Solve These Questions**
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the basic structure of each program, and incrementally add logic and features.
2. **Modularize**: Write reusable functions for repeated tasks to make your code more modular and easier to maintain.
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Ensure your solution works for edge cases such as negative numbers, empty input, and large datasets.
4. **Optimize**: Once you have a working solution, try to optimize it for better performance (e.g., reducing time complexity or using efficient algorithms).
5. **Use Comments**: Add comments to your code for better understanding and easier readability.
