# **Conditional Statements in C**  

This folder focuses on **Conditional Statements**, a crucial part of programming that enables decision-making in code. With these constructs, we can control the flow of program and execute specific blocks of code based on conditions, making programs dynamic and interactive.

## ðŸš€ **Topics Covered**

1. **If-Else Statements**  
   - Allows the program to make decisions based on conditions.  
   - Includes `if`, `else if`, and `else` for handling multiple scenarios.  

2. **Switch-Case Statements**  
   - Handles multiple predefined cases efficiently with cleaner syntax.  
   - Useful for scenarios like menu-driven programs.
   - Ternary
        ```Condition ? doSomething if TRUE : doSomething if FALSE```

3. **Nested Conditions**  
   - Executes conditions hierarchically.  
   - Suitable for handling complex decision-making scenarios.

## ðŸŒŸ **Quick Tips**

1. **Choosing the Right Conditional Construct:**  
   - Use **`if-else`** for dynamic, non-predefined conditions.  
   - Use **`switch-case`** for fixed, discrete values to enhance readability and maintainability.  

2. **Avoid Over-Nesting:**  
   - Minimize nesting to keep the code readable and manageable.  
   - Break complex conditions into separate functions for better clarity.  

3. **Switch with Default Cases:**  
   - Always include a `default` case in `switch` statements to handle unexpected inputs.  

4. **Logical Expressions in Conditions:**  
   - Combine conditions effectively using logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) for more advanced decision-making.

## ðŸ›  **How to Run These Programs**

1. Open a terminal or IDE supporting C programming (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio Code, or Code::Blocks).  
2. Compile the program using the following command:  
   ```bash
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name
   ```  
3. Run the compiled program:  
   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```
